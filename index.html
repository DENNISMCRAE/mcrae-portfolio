        <h2> BIKE SPECIFICATIONS & HISTORY</h2>
        <li>The Honda CBR600RR is a 599 cc (36.6 cu in) sport bike, part of the CBR series that was introduced by Honda in 2003 as a race replica version of Honda's CBR600F series.</li>
        <li>In 2005, the CBR600RR received a major revision with new bodywork, fully adjustable inverted front forks, disc brakes with radial-mounted four-piston calipers, and a new aluminium frame, swingarm and rear shock. The midrange power was also increased. These changes along with additional refinements to the engine and exhaust system brought CBR600RR's wet weight down by 10.0 kg (22 lb), and dry weight by 4.1 kg (9 lb)[3][4][5] The 2006 model was unchanged from the 2005 model.</li>
